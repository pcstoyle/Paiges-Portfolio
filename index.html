    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm excited to meet you! My name is Paige. For over a decade now, I've been in Health and Wellnss, Healthcare and Fitness. I love my work with people and in this industry, however, it's certainly started to take a toll on my body. I decided it's time for a career change that would allow for more consistant hours, reliable work and something that provided a new challenge, which called for a skillset update - enter coding bootcamp! 
    By the end of this bootcamp, I hope to be a competitor in the developing marketplace and land with a company that will allow me to continue to learn and grow with hands on experience. I learn quickly, take feedback and apply it immediately, and am excited to hit the ground running. 
    In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, Luna; I'm a foodie and love to try new restaraunts, and I love to travel and explore new places. 
    Please take a look at my work and let me know how you feel! I'm very much looking forward to connecting with you. 
    </p>
